            "me": "My name is Hudson, and Thomas and I have been passionate about Cardano ever since late 2019 / early 2020. It has immense potential to be beneficial for everyone around the world, especially from the lens of climate change.",
            "server": "Cloud based, soon to be hybrid: each node has 16gb of ram, 6 CPU cores, and 320GB ssd storage, hosted across the globe.",
            "company": "Why 'KoiPond?' Well, back in 2018 when I, Hudson, was younger, I visited Japan with my family. While I was there I came to realize that society there is much more progressive and business oriented than the one that I come from in Tennessee. Visiting helped me to grow a deep understanding of Japanese culture and business. Koi fish represent good fortune in the face of hard times, as well as friendship. I think that Cardano, as well as the Cardano community, embody these qualities as well. I want this pool to be a tribute to the beauty and success of Japan, and I cannot wait to visit again one day in the future and see the progress it has made with Cardano."
